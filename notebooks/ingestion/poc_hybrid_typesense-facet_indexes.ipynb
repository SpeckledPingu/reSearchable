However, should the retired firefighter or police officer die after the date on which he or she would have accumulated 30 years of credited service hereunder and be survived by a spouse to whom he or she was legally married at the time of the retiree's or participant's death, regardless of whether the marriage occurred before or after the participant's departure from service, a spousal survivor's benefit may be payable pursuant to any of the following: (1) Upon the retirement of the legally married participant, prior to payment of any retirement benefit and in accordance with procedures established by the city, the participant shall elect to either: a. Provide a spousal survivor's benefit upon the participant's death; or b. receive an unreduced monthly retirement benefit. (2) If a participant elects to provide a spousal survivor's benefit, then upon the participant's death: a. The monthly spousal survivor's benefit shall be equal to 60 percent of the monthly retirement benefit which the retiree was receiving or was entitled to receive prior to his or her death or which the participant would have been entitled to receive had he or she retired on the day preceding his or her death as if the surviving spouse was entitled to a benefit under Section 45-37A-51.228(c) and Section 45-37A-51.229; and b. the monthly retirement benefit payable to the participant during his or her life will be reduced to reflect the spousal survivor's benefit on an actuarially equivalent basis pursuant to certain actuarial factors adopted by the board. The survivor's benefit shall cease if the survivor remarries; provided, however, in the event the survivor remarries and that marriage is terminated by annulment, divorce, or death of the survivor's spouse, then on such termination, the survivor again shall be eligible to receive the survivor's benefit. (3) If a legally married participant elects to receive an unreduced monthly retirement benefit, then upon the participant's death, no monthly spousal survivor's benefit will be payable, and the monthly retirement benefit payable to the participant during his or her life will not be reduced to reflect any spousal survivor's benefit. To effect a participant's election to receive an unreduced monthly retirement benefit, the participant's spouse, at the time of the participant's election, shall agree to the participant's election and waive any spousal survivor's benefits in accordance with procedures established by the city.

      "Section 36-27-170 Participation in plan. (a) As governed by this subsection, there exists as a part of this retirement system, an optional account known as the Deferred Retirement Option Plan, which may be cited as \"DROP.\" The purpose of DROP is to allow, contractually, in lieu of immediate withdrawal from service and receipt of a retirement allowance, continued employment for a specific period of time, coupled with the deferral of receipt of a retirement allowance until the end of such period of participation, at which time the member shall withdraw from service. (b) Participation in DROP is an option available to any member of this retirement system who meets all of the following: (1) Has at least 25 years of creditable service exclusive of sick leave. (2) Is at least 55 years of age, or in the case of a state police member, is at least 52 years of age. (3) Is eligible for service retirement. (c) An election to participate in DROP may be made in one year increments not to exceed five years, nor to be less than three years. A member may participate in DROP only one time. Any voluntary termination within the first three years in DROP will result in a forfeiture of a portion of his or her DROP account that constitutes the retirement allowance. However, member contributions will not be forfeited nor will any interest attributable to the retirement allowance. There will be no forfeiture if the participation period is interrupted due to an involuntary dismissal, disability, involuntary transfer of his or her spouse, or death of the participant. (d) A member who chooses to participate in DROP may elect an option allowance set out for members of the Employees' Retirement System in subsection (d) of Section 36-27-16 at the beginning of the participation period. Otherwise, he or she shall receive the maximum benefit. Such election shall be irrevocable once the participation period begins except as otherwise provided in this chapter. (e) For purposes of DROP, sick leave may not be converted for purposes of establishing retirement eligibility, nor used in the calculation of the original retirement allowance except as provided in Section 36-27-171. A person electing to enter the DROP program is not eligible for a lump-sum payment for any annual or sick leave until withdrawal from service. (f) The election to participate in DROP shall be made in accordance with procedures set forth in a uniform and nondiscriminatory election and application form adopted by the Board of Control. The election to participate in DROP may be made at any time on or after the date the member becomes eligible to participate as set out in subsection (b). Such application must be made at least 30 days, but not more than 90 days, before the effective date of participation in DROP, and shall be made no later than March 24, 2011. A member must be eligible to participate, as provided above, at the time the application is made. (g) Upon the effective date of the commencement in DROP, the member's service shall remain as it existed on that date for the duration of DROP. Once a member enters DROP, service credit purchases are prohibited. Both the employer and employee member contribution shall continue to be made. The monthly retirement allowance that would have been payable, had the person elected to withdraw from service and receive a retirement allowance, shall be paid into a DROP account that reflects the credits attributed to the person in DROP. However, the monies shall remain a part of the regular retirement fund until disbursed to the participating member in accordance with this section. Any monies paid into this account are subject to the exemptions set out in Section 36-27-28. (h)(1) The DROP account shall earn interest at the same rate that interest is posted to active member accounts as defined in subdivision (12) of Section 36-27-1. A person who participates in this plan shall not be eligible to receive a retiree cost-of-living increase while participating in DROP, and shall not be eligible for a retiree cost-of-living increase until participation in the plan ceases and he or she withdraws from service and has been receiving a retirement allowance for at least one full year. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, for any member who has fulfilled his or her obligation under DROP and does not withdraw from service and any member who begins participation in DROP on or before April 1, 2011, and fulfills his or her obligation under DROP and does not withdraw from service, the amount of interest payable on benefit deposits after March 24, 2011, shall be the lesser of (1) the investment performance of the immediately preceding fiscal year but no less than $0, or (2) as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of Section 36-27-171. (i) DROP shall not be subject to any fees, charges, or other similar expenses of any kind for any purpose. (j) Participation in DROP shall not affect the rights of any state employee under the state personnel system, including, but not limited to, his or her rights to longevity pay. (k) Participation in DROP shall not affect the accrual of annual and sick leave by the participant. (l) Participants in DROP may receive salary cost-of-living adjustments and salary increases.

(b)(1) All employees of any such city (except members of the police or fire departments thereof) who have heretofore been covered by the benefits established by the provisions of Acts 1951, No. 773, Regular Session 1951 (Acts 1951, p. 1342), as amended, and who by action of the city commission or like governing body of such city become eligible to participate in the state employees pension plan, shall be entitled to receive the following benefits from the city, to be calculated as of the effective date of becoming eligible to participate in the state employees pension plan: a. Any employee eligible for retirement, upon retiring or otherwise leaving the employ of such city and becoming eligible to receive retirement benefits under Act 773, shall receive monthly an amount equal to the monthly benefits provided by Act 773. b. Any employee not eligible to receive benefits under Act 773, upon retiring or otherwise leaving the employ of said city, and upon reaching his or her sixtieth birthday, shall receive monthly an amount equal to two and one-half percent of his or her monthly wages, multiplied by the number of years (including any fractional part of a year) of employment with such city, prior to the date when he or she became eligible to participate in the state employees retirement plan. c. Any employee may elect to not share in the benefits established by Act 773 and in the benefits guaranteed by subsections (a) and (b) at any time prior to his or her becoming eligible to receive retirement benefits, and upon filing with the governing body of the city written notice of such election shall be reimbursed all sums theretofore contributed to the pension plan established by said Act 773, as amended, and shall not thereafter receive any pension benefits from such city. d.

(2) It is further provided that when the monthly compensation received by any such employee as salary at the time of his or her retirement is utilized in computing the payment made by the city pursuant to Act 773, or pursuant to the terms of this section, there shall be included in such monthly salary one-twelfth of the amount of the employee’s annual incentive pay at the time of retirement.

Before the establishment of the public safety personnel retirement system, municipal firemen and policemen, employees of the Arizona highway patrol and other public safety personnel in the state of Arizona were covered under various local, municipal and state retirement programs. These heterogeneous programs provided for wide and significant differentials in employee contribution rates, benefit eligibility provisions, types of benefit protection and benefit formulas. B. In order to provide a uniform, consistent and equitable statewide program for public safety personnel who are regularly assigned hazardous duty in the employ of the state of Arizona or a political subdivision thereof, this retirement system was created effective as of July 1, 1968, as an amendment to and continuation of three prior systems. Groups of employees covered under the three prior systems as of June 30, 1968, and the assets and liabilities accumulated thereunder for such employees, are transferred with prior service credits to this retirement system as of the effective date, and both they and their employers shall be required to make stipulated contributions to support the system's benefit structure on a sound actuarial basis. Future employees in such groups shall commence participation in, and contributions to, the system immediately on commencement of covered employment. C. The provisions of this system shall not be construed to authorize the granting of any retirement benefits to persons who are retired as of the effective date of this article, except as described in sections 38-849 and 38-853. D. Additional eligible groups of public safety personnel will participate in the system pursuant to election by their employer for such coverage under an appropriate joinder agreement. E. The public safety personnel retirement system is a jural entity that may sue and be sued.\n",

However, should the retired firefighter or police officer die after the date on which he or she would have accumulated 30 years of credited service hereunder and be survived by a spouse to whom he or she was legally married at the time of the retiree's or participant's death, regardless of whether the marriage occurred before or after the participant's departure from service, a spousal survivor's benefit may be payable pursuant to any of the following: (1) Upon the retirement of the legally married participant, prior to payment of any retirement benefit and in accordance with procedures established by the city, the participant shall elect to either: a. Provide a spousal survivor's benefit upon the participant's death; or b. receive an unreduced monthly retirement benefit. (2) If a participant elects to provide a spousal survivor's benefit, then upon the participant's death: a. The monthly spousal survivor's benefit shall be equal to 60 percent of the monthly retirement benefit which the retiree was receiving or was entitled to receive prior to his or her death or which the participant would have been entitled to receive had he or she retired on the day preceding his or her death as if the surviving spouse was entitled to a benefit under Section 45-37A-51.228(c) and Section 45-37A-51.229; and b. the monthly retirement benefit payable to the participant during his or her life will be reduced to reflect the spousal survivor's benefit on an actuarially equivalent basis pursuant to certain actuarial factors adopted by the board. The survivor's benefit shall cease if the survivor remarries; provided, however, in the event the survivor remarries and that marriage is terminated by annulment, divorce, or death of the survivor's spouse, then on such termination, the survivor again shall be eligible to receive the survivor's benefit.
